##Description
This project is my first attempt at Javascript. This project was very challenging as it cascades in the opposite direction of what I am used to with other languages such as python.


##Installation
No installation required. This is a HTML based project containing HTML, CSS and Javascript files which will run in any browser.

##Usage
Open application in browser, select paramiters and enjoy a new hard to break password!
